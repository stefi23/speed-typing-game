## Why I've build this?

Created this Web App following the [React Advance course on Scrimba](https://scrimba.com/) wanting to practice using React Hooks (useState, useRef, useEffect). The new things learned were the difference between `setInterval` and `setTimeout`.

- [React](https://reactjs.org/docs/create-a-new-react-app.html) with `useState`, `useRef` and the `useEffect` Hook.
